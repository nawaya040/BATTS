# BATTS (Bayesian Additive Trees for Two-Sample comparison)

This package implements the algorithms for the boosting and the Bayesian additive trees of Awaya, Xu, and Ma (2025).

### Install

The package may be easily installed using `devtools` as follows:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("nawaya040/BATTS")
```

You can see how to use the functions in the example.
